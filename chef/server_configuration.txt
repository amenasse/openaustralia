A rough guide to setting up and configuring the openaustralia server:

* Install FreeBSD (I'm using 7.0 currently) (Install ports collection and don't add another user other than root)
* Ensure you allocate plenty of space for the / slice (2-3 GB at least).
* Update ports tree
# portsnap fetch update
* Allow root login over ssh (vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
* Restart sshd: /etc/rc.d/sshd restart
* Need to install java by hand due to license agreement (see chef/cookbooks/java/recipes/default.rb)
* Install Rubygems: pkg_add -r ruby18-gems
* Upgrade Rubygems:
# rehash
# gem update
# gem update --system
# mv /usr/local/bin/gem18 /usr/local/bin/gem (Not required if using 7.1)
* Install Chef dependencies:
# gem sources -a http://gems.opscode.com
# gem install chef --version 0.5.4 (make sure that there is no chef-0.5.5.gem in the current directory)
* Create the chef gem on another machine:
# git clone git://github.com/mlandauer/chef.git
* Install the following gems required to build chef: cucumber,rspec,merb-core (gem install)
* Build the chef client/solo gem
# cd chef
# rake gem
* copy it here: scp chef-0.5.x.gem root@test.org:
* Install chef: gem install chef-0.5.x.gem
* Synchronise the clock a little better than before: ntpdate tick.ucla.edu
* Ensure that in Capfile, port for ssh is at the default and the user is set to root
* From the other machine perform the deployment:
# gem install capistrano
# cap chef
# cap deploy

* Note that some steps for wordpress will have to done manually due to bugs or missing features in chef.
